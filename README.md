### <<<One file to rule them all!>>>


All contributers! Here is the protocall for this GitHub! \\RIGHT NEOW //


## First..
How to solve our problems of Merge Conflicts and branches: 

- Work only on your branch! No pushing to main until everyone is ready 

- You want only ONE repository for your project on your computer! It cannot be on another cloud. Find and determine where that is and DO NOT TOUCH IT
  
- Close out Unity before pushing your file to GitHub! Unity is fine with reloading a pull while working, but doesnt like to be running when pushing a commit to the hub.
  
- Pull and Fetch Orgin before Pushing your file to the hub. PLEASE AND THANK YOU! <3 

 ## NEXT STEPS...

- Go to the GitHub website
  - Make a new branch titled "YourName_Branch" from the most recent main Branch.
  - Open Github desktop. 
  * If you have multiple branches, there is an option to merge or "squash" them into one. Make sure your final branch is named "YourName_Branch" when it is done. 
- Commit these changes on the GitHub Desktop (titled something like squash branch commit)

** Errors may be thrown at this point
  
  - Publish your branch! 
    - Commit your changes on the GitHub Desktop (title this something like publish branch commit)
      - Pull for changes, even tho this wont have happened yet, just to make sure all is clear
- Push your commited changes to Github through the desktop app

  Errors may be thrown at this point

  Refresh time!
- Now everyone can see new branches on their list of branches if they refresh their repository.
- Refresh GH website and see if your branch shows up on the list in the branch dropdown menu
- Pull for any changes

  IF ALL HAS GONE WELL...

  Each person now has a fully published branch! And if things run smoothly soon merge conflicts will be terminated >:)

  Last Steps:
  
- Switch back to the main branch on your github desktop
- Pull for any changes
- merge your "YourName_Branch" with the main branch
- commit changes to main
- Before pushing to main, check that you are clear to do so. In case there is conflict or someone else is pushing to main, etc. Always good to double check.
- Push your changes to the main branch from GitHub desktop.


Post Set-Up:
  
- Download a pull from another person on the team you are working with. If you want to see if certain things will work together, then you will have to work on different aspects. If you want to know certain code will not cause a merge conflict then you are going to have to compare your branches and communicate with other members.
- A pull request is asking for a copy of your team members branch to toy around with on your own end, and if you communicate well enough you can get frequent updates that fix bugs with their code and yours  
- Each week (or more) there will be full merge with the main branch documented by everyone so that we have milestones we can go back to.

In the end there need to be at least three stages of documentation saved from the project: 
1. A - the very first version (what we have right now, very ooga booga)
3. B - the middle version 
4. C - final version
