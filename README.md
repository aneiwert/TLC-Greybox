Update Feb 03 2026! 

### <<<One file to rule them all!>>>


All contributers! Here is the protocall for this GitHub! \\RIGHT NEOW //


## First..
How to solve our problems of Merge Conflicts and branches: 

- Work only on your branch! No pushing to main until everyone is ready 

- You want only ONE repository for your project on your computer! It cannot be on another cloud. Find and determine where that is and DO NOT TOUCH IT
  
- Close out Unity before pushing your file to GitHub! Unity is fine with reloading a pull while working, but doesnt like to be running when pushing a commit to the hub.
  
- Pull and Fetch Orgin before Pushing your file to the hub. PLEASE AND THANK YOU! <3 

 ## NEXT STEPS...

- Go to the GitHub website
  
- Make a new branch titled "YourName_Branch" from the most recent main Branch.
  
- Open Github desktop.
  
  * If you have multiple branches, there is an option to merge or "squash" them into one. Make sure your final branch is named "YourName_Branch" when it is done. 
- Commit these changes on the GitHub Desktop (titled something like squash branch commit)

_Errors may be thrown at this point_
  
- Publish your branch! 
- Commit your changes on the GitHub Desktop (title this something like publish branch commit)
      - Pull for changes, even tho this wont have happened yet, just to make sure all is clear
- Push your commited changes to Github through the desktop app

_  Errors may be thrown at this point_

**Refresh time!**
- Now everyone can see new branches on their list of branches if they refresh their repository.
- Refresh GH website and see if your branch shows up on the list in the branch dropdown menu
- Pull for any changes

_ IF ALL HAS GONE WELL..._

  **Each person now has a fully published branch! And if things run smoothly soon merge conflicts will be terminated >:)**


## Post Set-Up:
  
- **Download a pull from another person on the team you are working with** - If you want to see if certain things will work together, then you will have to work on different aspects. If you want to know certain code will not cause a merge conflict then you are going to have to compare your branches and communicate with other members.
- 
- **A pull request is** -  asking for a copy of your team members branch to toy around with on your own end, and if you communicate well enough you can get frequent updates that fix bugs with their code and yours
-  
  **Each week (or more) there will be full merge with the main branch documented by everyone. This is so we have milestones to go back to**

   
### Some notes if you are here: 
In the end there need to be at least three stages of documentation saved from the project: 
1. A - the very first version (what we have right now, very ooga booga)
3. B - the middle version (next two weeks, or after the next sprint, Week 7-8)
4. C - final version (week 11 the very last version)
